Performed the following operations based on the value of window size:
• If the window size is less than 720px, then the 1x4 flexible grid becomes a 2x2 grid. That is, the 3rd
and 4th columns slide down onto the 2nd row.
• If the window size is less than 360px, then the 1x4 flexible grid becomes 4x1 grid. Each column
slides under the one before it. The 2nd column slides under the 1st , the 3rd slides under the 2nd , and
the 4th slides under the 3rd 

These operations are working.
